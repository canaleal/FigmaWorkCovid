# About
<p>The 1st Covid app lets users view Covid-19 data, request help, and view documentation. Users will first need to register and then use the app.
After loging in, users can then view Covid data, recieve tips, read up on the FAQs, and even perform a self check.
Contacting a volunteer is done using the built in Call/Text/Video call system. The top Volunteers are shown in a seperate menu and can be selected.</p>
<br>
<p>The 2nd Covid app is for Volunteers that want to help their communities. Volunteers can Call, Text, and Video Call users and even accept Help Requests like getting pills. For management, Volunteers can track their appointments and click complete when finished. Volunteers can also view their recent calls with users in the Recents menu.</p>
